# ðŸš€ Installation

### TailAdmin HTML - Tailwind + Alpine.js

To use the TailAdmin dashboard template first youâ€™ll have to install it.

Follow these steps to install [TailAdmin Tailwind + AlpineJS](https://tailadmin.com/download) template:

**Note:** Youâ€™ll have to have Node.js installed on your machine. Otherwise, these commands wonâ€™t work.

1. Download the dashboard template from TailAdmin, and extract it.
2. Then navigate to the project folder and run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

1. After that run this command to start the local server.

```bash
npm run start
```

Now you can make the changes.

After youâ€™ve made the changes, run this command to generate the **build** folder, you can upload this build folder to the server.

```bash
npm run build
```



### TailAdmin React - Tailwind + React.js

In this part, we are going to show you how to install the TailAdmin Tailwind + ReactJS template.

Follow these steps to install the templates.

**Note:** Weâ€™ve used **Vite** to develop the Tailwind + ReactJS template.

1. Download the dashboard template from TailAdmin.
2. Then navigate to the project folder and run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

1. After that run this command to start the local server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

When the dev command runs successfully the Dashboard will be open on port:[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

Now you can customize the dashboard and see the changes locally.

After that, run this command to generate the **build** folder. You can upload this build folder to your server, and the dashboard will be live.
