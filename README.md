You will learn how to install and set up TailAdmin, customize the template to suit your needs, and make use of its built-in components and plugins.

TailAdmin is a Tailwind CSS-based admin dashboard template that provides developers with everything they need to create a complete, data-driven back-end, dashboard, or admin panel.&#x20;

TailAdmin provides two types of dashboard templates: one powered by HTML (Tailwind and Alpine.js) and another powered by React (Tailwind and React.js)

Choose the one that meets your requirements and build the dashboard youâ€™ve always wanted to build.
