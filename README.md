TailAdmin is a Tailwind CSS-based admin dashboard template that provides developers with everything they need to create a complete, data-driven back-end, dashboard, or admin panel.&#x20;

TailAdmin provides two types of dashboard templates: one powered by Tailwind and AlpineJS and another powered by Tailwind and ReactJS.

Choose the one that meets your requirements and build the dashboard youâ€™ve always wanted to build.
